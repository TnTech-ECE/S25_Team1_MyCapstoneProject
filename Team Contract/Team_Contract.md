## Expectations

### Work Distribution to be Even
- We intend to distribute work fairly and evenly.
- Play each other's strengths accordingly.
- Work as efficiently as possible and avoid super late nights when possible.
  - This means respecting deadlines and communicating where you are in the process of completion.
  - We do not intend for people to have to pick up the slack without valid reasons.

### Communication
- Communication should be a top priority in everything we do, but that does not mean blowing up each other's phones at odd hours.
- We must communicate about our availability, specifically on when and where we are meeting.
  - We do not want to waste anyone's time.
- Everyone is to contribute.
  - No matter our personal interest, we will uphold our duties to the team so that no one must do other people's work.

## Meetings
- Everyone is expected to be at all meetings unless valid reasoning presents itself.
- The more prepared, better communication we have, and more work we get done means we will meet accordingly.
- Conflicts should not be turned into drama but addressed promptly and professionally.
  - Problems should not be allowed to "fester" or grow into bigger issues.

## Deadlines
- Deadlines are to be respected and not messed with.
  - Our teammates count on everyone having their assignments done on time.
  - Excuses are like armpits; everyone has them, and they all stink.
  - Keep excuses to a minimum.

## Summary
In summary, we agree to honor each other's time, work, and effort by respecting deadlines, communicating, and pulling our own weight. Excuses will be kept to a minimum while still maintaining a high level of professionalism and picking each other up where needed. Accountability to the team as well as ourselves is key to success.
