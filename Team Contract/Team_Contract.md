Team Contract

Expectations

Work distribution to be even

We intend to distribute work fairly and evenly

Play each other's strengths accordingly

Work as efficiently as possible and avoid super late nights when possible

This means respecting deadlines and communicating where you at in the process of completion.

We do not intend for people to have to pick up the slack without valid reasons

Communication should be a top priority about everything we do, that does not mean however to blow up each other's phones at odd hours.

We also must communicate about our availability, specifically on when and where we are meeting. We do not want to waste anyone's time.
Everyone is to contribute

No matter our personal interest we will uphold our duties to the team so as that no one must do other peoples work
Meetings

Everyone is expected to be at all meetings unless valid reasoning presents itself

The more prepared, better communication we have, and more work we get done means we will meet accordingly

Conflicts should not be turned into drama, but addressed promptly and professionally

Problems should not be allowed to "fester" or grow into bigger issues
Deadlines are simply to be respected and not messed with

Our teammates count on everyone having their assignments done on time
Excuses are like armpits, everyone has them and they all stink

Keep excuses to a minimum
In summary we agree to honor each other's time, work and effort by respecting deadlines, communicating and pulling our own weight. Excuses will be kept to a minimum while still maintaining a high level of professionalism and picking each other up where needed. Accountability of the team as well as our selves is key to success.
