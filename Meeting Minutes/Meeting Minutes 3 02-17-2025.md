## Member Updates

Evan - This week I worked on several things. The main thing was the project proposal, completing my parts for that as well as revising. I also coordinated our first in person customer meeting last Thursday, which included the ME team. I also began some more in depth research on things like autonomous lawn mowers and non GPS navigation.

Connor - Before meeting Thursday with sawyer and Elias from devcom we had started the project proposal and I had completed the introduction and the survey of existing resources sections. The meeting we were having was pre determined to be informal so I did not do much preparation for it.

Kamden - This week, I worked on the Project Proposal specifically the budget, timeline, and specifications. I also spoke to Dr. Van Neste and persuaded him to become our Advsior. I have also done more work on the repository to clean up and figure out the UI.
