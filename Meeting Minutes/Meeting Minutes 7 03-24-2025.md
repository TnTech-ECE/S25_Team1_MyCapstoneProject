## Member Updates

Evan - This week I revised the conceptual design and lost to team 4 on peer review. We met with Devcom and the ME team separately where we were able to better designate who was working on what and give the MEâ€™s a deadline to have some preliminary stuff done so we can have something more solid to go off of.

Connor - This week I worked a little bit on the conceptual design during peer review

Kamden - This week, we made a ton of progress in our design and idea of the project. I think we are on a good track to have something done this semester and next.

Wayne - This week I expanded my knowledge on the navigation system and implementation of said system. I also did some research on potential sensors.

Cooper - I looked into getting a roomba to take apart and check its pressure sensor for obstacles avoidance. The team also had a biweekly meeting with Devcom.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)
This week, we met twice to really dig in what progress we had on this project. We have now formulated a clearer picture of what we can do with this project and are comfortable working with Devcom and the ME team.

## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Pass the Conceptual Design Review. Enjoy Spring break.

Evan - I intend to make whatever changes necessary to the conceptual to pass peer review even tho I have no clue how to appease to people just to get stars. 

Connor - Next week I hope to get the changes made for the conceptual design and get it passed through the instructor, advisor and customer

Kamden - Enjoy the break, keep researching what the best controller would be, help aid in the robot design and placement of parts.

Wayne - In the coming week I plan to make tweaks to the conceptual design as necessary based on feedback from Mr. Rentschler and Dr. Van Neste. I also intend to do some reading on the provided text from DEVCOM. 

Cooper - Potentially begin working on the detailed design.
