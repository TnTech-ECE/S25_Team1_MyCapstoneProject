## Member Updates

Evan - This week I revised the conceptual design and lost to team 4 on peer review. We met with Devcom and the ME team separately where we were able to better designate who was working on what and give the MEâ€™s a deadline to have some preliminary stuff done so we can have something more solid to go off of.

Connor -

Kamden - This week, we made a ton of progress in our design and idea of the project. I think we are on a good track to have something done this semester and next.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)
This week, we met twice to really dig in what progress we had on this project. We have now formulated a clearer picture of what we can do with this project and are comfortable working with Devcom and the ME team.


## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Pass the Conceptual Design Review. Enjoy Spring break.

Evan - I intend to make whatever changes necessary to the conceptual to pass peer review even tho I have no clue how to appease to people just to get stars.
