## Member Updates

Evan - This past week I reached out to check in with both the ME team and Devcom since they came back online. I did some troubleshooting on the connection of the power system and talked to both storm and Dr. pardue about our issues with the chassis. 

Connor - This past week I worked primarily on the poster and in GitHub for the inventory. I also helped kamden in testing the hardwired communication aspect from a laptop to the pi and it was successful. 

Kamden - This week, I was able to test the ethernet port connection to see how file transfer would work. It seemed to be a trustable method for robot communication.

Wayne - This week I got a framework set in place for SLAM using force fed odometry.

Cooper - Met with Devcom.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)
Met to update Devcom and discuss poster.

## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Tidy the robot up.

Evan - This week is all about getting this joker ready to go for experimental analysis and our presentation. I intend to help Connor on the poster as well.

Connor - This next week I hope to work more on the poster, begin writing the experimental analysis and help anywhere I can with other subsystems. 

Kamden - Figure out doom plan for chassis. Check system integration.

Wayne - In the next week I plan to get SLAM functioning with the force fed odometry and gather sufficient data to prove functionality given wheel encoder data.

Cooper - Work with group on poster.
