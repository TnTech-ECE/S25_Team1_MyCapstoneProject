2. Cleaned station up and started inventory.

3. Discussed battle plan for next week.

## Action Items From Past Meetings

1. Assemble bot.

## Member Updates

Evan - Last week we worked hard on getting the minimal prototype working. Meetings with the ME team have slowed way down due to the separation of the chassis.

Connor - Early this past week was spent getting everything together for the minimal functional prototype. After that, energy shifted toward other classes which limited work done for capstone in the latter half of the week. 

Kamden - Working on the bot, I was met with a lot of hard obstacles that could not be fixed in the current setting. I hope with more testing and trial and error, a lot of the kinks are figured out.

Wayne - This week I got a prototype for the robots E-Stop function working. I also incorporated a launch file for ease of access to these processes.

Cooper - Working to get robot moving.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)
Kept progress on robot with chassis building and sensor testing.


## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Finish cleaning up the robot and integrate sensor communication.

Evan - This week I intend to do testing on the battery/power system to ensure functionality. This will coincide with getting the autonomous part working. I will reach out to the ME team to see if they have any last minute things they need to run by us.

Connor - This next week I hope to help with more mounting, cable management and sensor testing. I also will need to do research on how the pi is going to communicate through the Ethernet for real-time bidirectional communication. 

Kamden - Fix communication to the chassis and start on coordinate navigation.

Wayne - In the next week I plan to get the autonomous function into a working prototype phase and begin running tests. 

Cooper - Continuing to try and get the robot moving.
