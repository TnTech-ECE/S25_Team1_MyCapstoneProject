## Key Points

1. Met with Dr. Van Neste to give an update.

2. Discussed potential building help for the group.

## Action Items From Past Meetings

1. ROS 2 install and progress on Pi 5 plus build.

## Member Updates

Evan - Last week I met with everyone to get a game plan together on how to go about assembling everything. 

Connor - This past week was spent mainly brainstorming ideas of how to lift the “box” to have clearance for the tracks on the bot. As well as gathering a gameplan for this next week

Kamden - This week, I was able to make some more progress with the pi but have already met some walls that still need breaking through.

Wayne - This week I got a working concept for the depth sensor and began implementing the LiDAR onto the minimal functional prototype

Cooper - This week, I helped make pieces for the robot.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)
We are in full build prep to have the bot ready for the min design due date.


## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Get more of the robot complete as well as have it moving by the pi alone.

Evan - This week I intend to put that plan into motion which we made a solid start today.

Connor - This next week I hope to help code the bot and help install the box clearance blocks with Evan and cooper.

Kamden - I really need to have the pi moving using ros 2 and coordinates to feel good about this project.

Wayne - In the next week I plan to get the depth sensor finished up and start incorporating everything for the minimal functional prototype

Cooper - I plan to be ready to aid in the build phase of the bot.
