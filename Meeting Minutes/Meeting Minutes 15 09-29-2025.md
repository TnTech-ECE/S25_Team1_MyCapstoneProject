## Member Updates

Evan - This week I waited on parts and communicated with the ME team on what they were providing. 

Connor - This past week I met with the CSC team and waited for parts to be delivered.

Kamden - This week, I got an email that the parts have made it and I have relayed that info in every meeting.

Wayne - This week I got bogged down with a few tests and didn't make much progress on the navigation subsystem. 

Cooper - Bi-weekly Devcom meeting. Met with Dr. Van Neste about robot expectations. Most parts have come in.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)
Three meetings were held on the same day. We are hopeful that everyone is on the same loop now and we just have to start building the robot now.


## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Put the parts in the lab and start with design.

Evan - I intend to meet up with the ME team to obtain those parts and make sure they will work with our battery. There’s potential that we have to provide a new battery but won’t pull the trigger on that until I verify we absolutely need it 

Connor - This next week, with the parts in I hope to get everything together and begin setting up the process of building the modular box. As well as research of how to get the bidirectional communication going.

Kamden - I plan to go by to get the parts inventoried and start marking up how we placing them in the box. Hopefully programming starts up soon.

Wayne - In the next week I plan to push as far into the plug and play approach as possible and hopefully have a functional design for use by two weeks time. 

Cooper - Potentially start putting parts together. Help team members were requested.
