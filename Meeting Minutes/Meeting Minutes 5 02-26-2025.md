Connor - This last week I have been focused mainly on fixing the project proposal in GitHub. I edited my sections, cleaning up format and the grammar.

Kamden - This week, the team worked hard on getting the proposal top notch so we could pass the review phase. I stayed on top of what all needed to be done and made sure each review was addressed and edits were made.
