## Action Items From Past Meetings

1. Complete Conceptual Design.

## Member Updates

Evan - This past week I have worked on finalizing the conceptual design, our biweekly meeting for Devcom and planning/setting up a biweekly meeting with the MEâ€™s. 

Connor - This past week I mainly just left a peer review and waited for Micah to give feedback on the conceptual design. 

Kamden - This past week, I helped answer questions towards what our design consisted of. I met with our advisor and discussed involvment and ideas going forward. I also reviewed any comments we had towards our design.

Wayne - This week I did some in depth research on how the sensors and the programming will all work cohesively to produce autonomous navigation. 

Cooper - The team had a biweekly meeting with the ME team.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)

This past week as well as today, we now have contact with our advisor as well as a good standing with the ME team. We have a better idea now on what we will be provided as well as what we are working with. We now have knowledge of motors as well as some more physical size of the robot.

## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. COMPLETE THE DESIGN.

Evan - For this week I intend to wrap up the conceptual design, try to do some more research on key components of our design and being communication with the comp sci team

Connor - This next week I plan for the conceptual design to be finished and sent to our advisor and eventually our customer. Then begin thinking about detailed design. 

Kamden - This week I plan to give more attention to critiquing the design and getting things moving. We need to reach out to our advisor and include him more on the project which I plan to assist with.

Wayne - In the coming week I plan to make tweaks to the conceptual design as necessary based on feedback from Mr. Rentschler and Dr. Van Neste. I also intend to nail down some parts for the navigation system and potentially finalize them for the design. 

Cooper - Depending on what the ME team has to say about the drivetrain, I intend to incorporate their work into the next design.
