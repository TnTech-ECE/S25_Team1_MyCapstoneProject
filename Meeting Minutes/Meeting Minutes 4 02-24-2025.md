## Member Updates

Evan - I reviewed project proposals and revised our own. The sections I focused on were formulating the problem and measures of success.

Connor - This last week was a bit hectic with the snow, however, I got a good bit done. I completed the peer reviews for the other teams I was assigned and began looking at the feedback of the peers who reviewed our proposal and editing accordingly. Specifically editing my section of “existing resources.” We then had our first meeting with Sawyer and two new members which essentially set us up on what the meetings will look like in the future. 

Kamden - Snowdays offset a lot of work on the project. Gantt chart is still in the process. Project proposal reviews went well for the most part. Discovred a lot of ideas on building the central board for the robot.

Wayne - This week I worked on making adjustments to the proposal as necessary as well as expanding my understanding of various project related topics. 

Cooper - I reviewed and edited the format of my section of the proposal.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)

Started biweekly meeting with Devcom to discuss how we would present updates and work with them. Spoke about the timeline and corrected what would be laid out this following semester and next.

For the Team: 1. Finish critiquing the Project Proposal. Finish the Gantt chart for proposal.

Evan - I intend to finalize our proposal and continue reading the text book sawyer sent.
