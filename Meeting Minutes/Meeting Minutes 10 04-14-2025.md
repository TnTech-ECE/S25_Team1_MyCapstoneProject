## Key Points

1. Met with ME and CS team to discuss progress and gather info on the project.

2. CS team spoke about how data would be sent and received to the pi.

3. ME team spoke about constraints with the chassis and future outlooks for it next semester.

## Action Items From Past Meetings

1. Keep pushing DD through peer ratings.

## Member Updates

Evan - This past week I worked on getting Devcoms approval on our conceptual design. Once that was taken care of I changed my focus to the detailed design and began on it where I got the bones put together and just need to put the time into finalizing things.

Connor - This past week I worked on the hardwired connection subsystem detailed design.

Kamden - Work on the GitHub and DD have been going okay. We for sure need to pick the pace up I believe but we are pushing ours through quite well.

Wayne - This week I did research into the navigation system and finished up my initial draft of the detailed design.

Cooper - I've been busy with DSD programming, so I was only able to label the sections for my portion of detailed design.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)
The meeting with CS and ME teams were productive but it leaves some more questions on the table about some intercommunication on the robot. All in all, after discussing the chassis, data sent to the pi, and how the coordinates would be read on the map, the idea of this project is getting set in stone.


## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Pass peer review for DD and hold on.

Evan - I intend to wrap up my detailed design this week and help out where needed. 

Connor - This next week I hope to help get other subsystem detailed designs up and running for peer review.

Kamden - I need to complete the OS DD and push that through review asap. I do think we are on track to pass peer review with out pieces but it will be coming in close.

Wayne - In the coming week I plan to revise my detailed design. I also intend to chip in on other detailed designs where necessary. 

Cooper - Hopefully I'll be able to start putting information into my detailed design.
