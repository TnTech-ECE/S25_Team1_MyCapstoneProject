## Member Updates

Evan - This past week I worked on getting Devcoms approval on our conceptual design. Once that was taken care of I changed my focus to the detailed design and began on it where I got the bones put together and just need to put the time into finalizing things.

Connor - This past week I worked on the hardwired connection subsystem detailed design.

Kamden - Work on the GitHub and DD have been going okay. We for sure need to pick the pace up I believe but we are pushing ours through quite well.

Wayne -

Cooper - I've been busy with DSD programming, so I was only able to label the sections for my portion of detailed design.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)



## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Pass peer review for DD and hold on.

Evan - I intend to wrap up my detailed design this week and help out where needed. 

Connor - This next week I hope to help get other subsystem detailed designs up and running for peer review.

Kamden - I need to complete the OS DD and push that through review asap. I do think we are on track to pass peer review with out pieces but it will be coming in close.

Wayne -

Cooper - Hopefully I'll be able to start putting information into my detailed design.
