## Key Points

1. Discussed parts on the conceptual design.

2. Discussed which sections each member would work on.

3. Formulated an action plan to get the design done.

## Action Items From Past Meetings

1. Critique Project Proposal document.

## Member Updates

Evan - This past week I worked hard on revising the project proposal and taking care of my parts of the conceptual design. I stayed in contact with the ME team as well.

Connor - This week I worked on the conceptual design, doing more research of how this problem can be solved in real life.

Kamden - This week, I did a lot more research into what conceptually the robot would do and with what parts it would function with.

Wayne - This week I worked on finishing up the first draft of the conceptual design. I also started research on the navigation system in an in depth form.

Cooper - I worked on and edited the drivetrain/motor portion of the conceptual design. The team also had a biweekly meeting with Devcom.

## Meeting Minutes (Summary)
This meeting we met briefly to discuss where the conceptual was going and what all we would need to tackle to have a decent review done by the other peers.

## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Receive feedback on Project Proposal and Conceptual Design.

Evan - This week we should pass peer review on the conceptual dive into deeper research overall

Connor - Next week I will be helping in cleaning up the conceptual design as peer review goes on.

Kamden - Next week, I hope to have good feedback on my sections and to have a better idea on what the robot would bring built with specifically with which components.

Wayne - In the coming week I plan to make tweaks to the conceptual design as necessary. I will also do more research and start forming a general concept for the navigation subsystem.

Cooper - I intend to continue working on the conceptual design with the team.
