# Introduction

In modern military and defense operations, maintaining reliable communication is essential for effective command and control. However, in contested environments where radio frequency communications are disrupted or unreliable, alternative methods are necessary to establish secure and persistent connectivity. The Cable Installation Robot for Contested Environments (CIRCE) is a semi-autonomous robotic system designed to deploy Ethernet cables and restore communication links while minimizing risk to personnel.

The CIRCE system comprises three primary components:
- **CirceBot**: The robotic platform responsible for physically deploying the cable.
- **CirceSoft**: The path-planning software that directs CirceBotâ€™s movements.
- **Hardline Communication Interface**: Enables telemetry transmission and control without reliance on radio frequency signals.

Designed for GPS-denied environments, the system ensures precise cable installation while maintaining secure and continuous communication.

The conceptual design of CIRCE focuses on developing a system capable of:
- Autonomously navigating to designated waypoints.
- Deploying up to 100 yards of Ethernet cable.
- Maintaining real-time telemetry communication with CirceSoft.

By integrating advanced navigation techniques, semi-autonomous control, and a robust cable-handling mechanism, CIRCE enhances operational efficiency and provides a resilient communication solution in contested environments.

# Fully Formulating the Problem

Establishing reliable communication in contested environments presents a significant challenge for military and defense operations. A common assumption is that the primary issue stems from the inability to use radio frequency communications in such conditions. However, alternative methods, such as hardwired connections, can provide a more secure and persistent solution. The challenge lies in efficiently deploying these connections without exposing personnel to unnecessary risk. Manual cable installation in hostile or GPS-denied environments is both dangerous and inefficient, making an automated solution highly desirable.

This is the problem that CIRCE is designed to address. Previous solutions to communication disruptions in contested environments have relied on ad hoc radio-frequency workarounds, which are vulnerable to jamming, interference, and detection by adversaries. In contrast, CIRCE offers a hardwired communication deployment system that is not susceptible to the same weaknesses.

CIRCE's design overcomes many of the limitations of past approaches by utilizing a semi-autonomous robotic platform to lay Ethernet cables efficiently and safely. Unlike human-operated solutions, which require personnel to be physically present in high-risk areas, CIRCE can autonomously navigate through GPS-denied environments while maintaining precise cable installation by receiving input from a base/headquarters. Furthermore, by eliminating reliance on RF signals, CIRCE ensures that communication links remain secure and operational.
